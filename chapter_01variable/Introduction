In this chapter, I present materials that I have compiled based on the content of Java learning videos I watched on Bilibili.

Initially, I thought that simply pasting the notes I took while watching would be sufficient, 
but I realized that this might make it difficult for others to understand and would not help retain the information effectively.

Therefore, as I continue with my Java studies, I am reviewing and reorganizing my past notes into a more easy-to-understand format.

Since it's difficult to complete everything in one day, I will prepare the materials in stages.

Although this record is primarily for my own review and understanding, I hope it will also be useful to others who are learning in a similar way.

P.S. I’ve been watching two different video series on Bilibili — one is too detailed, and the other is too simplistic 
— so I think it's necessary to combine the two to create a more balanced learning resource(basically by the simplistic one).
